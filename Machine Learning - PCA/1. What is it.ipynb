    "2. **Better visualization**: When we cannot get a good visualization due to high number of dimensions we use PCA to reduce it into a shadow of 2D or 3D features (or even more but convenient enough for better parallel coordinates or Andrew Curve, e.g. when you transfer 100 features into 10 features you cannot still depict it as 2D or 3D but you can get a much better Andrew Curve)\n",
